Amigo Weather app test

## instructions

All you need is to run npm start. on local host 3000. and type in a uk city

### with more time

With more time I could add more pictures to include more versions of the weather
- Added weekly forcasts.
- Made it mobile friendly and to resize all together, at the moment the picture image doesnt follow suit
- Added TDD.

Thank you Amigo for the oppertunity I had alot of fun with this one.
